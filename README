WAV File Editor

This program does some basic operations on .wav audio files.  After loading the
file, it displays basic information about the file, such as the sample rate.  An
input file and an output file must be specified as arguments.  The input file is
not modified.  The input file is loaded to RAM, processed with the user-selected
filters, then saved to the output file.  The user may select an arbitrary number
of filters (or even none) to apply.  The filters are applied in the left-to-
right order of how they appear as arguments after the input and output file
names.  I have included a couple sample .wav files, because I am not confident
that it works on all inputs.

Build Instructions:
1. make

Execution Instructions:
    bin/wav in_file out_file [arguments]
Arguments:
	-r              Reverses the audio file
    -a (f)          Amplifies the audio by the given ratio as a float
    -e (f) (f)      Adds an echo effect with the amplitude and delay
    -ts (f)         Trims the start of the file
	-te (f)         Trims the end of the file

Example Usage:
    bin/wav example1.wav out.wav -e 0.2 0.1
    bin/wav example1.wav out.wav -ts 2.71 -te 3.42
    bin/wav example2.wav out.wav -r

Note: if an input file has multiple data segments, my program will exhibit
undefined behavior!  To my understanding, most .wav files only contain one data
segment.
